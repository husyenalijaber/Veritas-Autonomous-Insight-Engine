## 1. Core Concept & Value: The "Trust But Verify" Agent

**Veritas** is an autonomous research engine built using the **Google Gemini API** to solve the critical problem of unreliable information generated by standard LLMs. In fields like **Climate Change** and **Public Health**, unverified facts pose significant risks. Veritas mandates a rigorous, structured verification process by implementing the **Orchestrator Pattern**.

### Key Value Proposition:
* **Automated Verification:** Significantly reduces the need for manual human fact-checking time.
* **Hallucination Reduction:** Separation of the data gathering (Researcher) from data validation (**Analyst**) eliminates inconsistencies and un verified claims in the final report.
* **Scalable Impact:** Provides verifiable and objective insights, ideal for policy-relevant research.

## 2. System Architecture: The 4-Agent Orchestrator

The system uses a sequential **Multi-Agent System** where tasks are delegated to four distinct, specialized agents:

| Agent | Primary Role | Core Function | Implemented Course Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 Planner** | Strategist | Translates the complex user request into a **structured, actionable research plan**. | Multi-Agent System |
| **🔎 Researcher** | Investigator | Executes the plan, utilizing **Tools (Function Calling)** via `ddgs` to gather **real-time, cited raw data**. | Tools & Memory |
| **🧠 Analyst** | Fact Checker | **The Critical Verification Layer.** Performs **sequential verification**, filters *noise*, checks for contradictions, and outputs a clean dataset. | Sequential Verification |
| **✍️ Writer** | Technical Reporter | Synthesizes the verified information into a final, professional **Markdown Report**. | Output Generation |

## 3. Setup and Execution 🚀

To run the project, you only need the **`Veritas_Agent.ipynb`** file and a **Google AI API Key**.

### Step 1: Installation and Dependencies

Open the **`Veritas_Agent.ipynb`** file in your environment (Kaggle or Colab). Run the first code cell to install the necessary packages.

```bash
# Install required libraries (output suppressed for a cleaner environment)
!pip install -q -U google-generativeai ddgs colorama markdown > /dev/null 2>&1
